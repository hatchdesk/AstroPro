        <h2>Astrology and Career Counselling</h2>
<p>In Vedic astrology, you can assess your career prospects by combining the influence of planets and key houses. As per astrologers, the 12 houses of one’s horoscope signifies different areas of life. Although each house and the planets positioned in them lay a significant impact on your career, the tenth house and its Lord mainly governs the maximum career prospects. It signifies the success, promotions, setbacks, job change, monetary hike and business expansion. If the planets like Sun, Moon, Jupiter, Mercury, unafflicted Saturn, Venus are positioned in the tenth house, then it means the native will receive opportunities and reach soaring heights in his/her career. 

Moreover, as per Career astrology, the planetary positions in the second, sixth and tenth houses help in determining the best career choice. The 5th house is studied to learn about natives’ talents and abilities. The ninth house is observed to explore the higher education possibilities. During career counseling through career astrology, the astrologers study all the houses, Dashas and astrological aspects to check the native’s aptitude and give them the best career guidance. They predict career possibilities and offer clarity and effective astrological remedies to improve their career. </p>
