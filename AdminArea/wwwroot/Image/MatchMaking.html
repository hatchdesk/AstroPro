  <h3>What happens during Kundli milan?</h3>

   <p>The whole process of horoscope matching is called AshtaKoot Milan in Vedic astrology. Here, Ashta means 8 and Kootas are categories. These eight categories of parameters depict different aspects of life. These 8 parameters are considered for measuring one’s compatibility with the other person. Each of these parameters carry some points, which in total make 36 gunas. The more the gunas match, the more compatible you are with the other person in your life.
    
    The eight parameters or categories among which the points have been divided are:-
    
    Varna - it is the classification of people in four categories namely Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra.
    
    Vashya - the Vashya denotes the power or dominance in Vedic astrology. Vahsya classifies a person into five types – Human, Wild Animals, Small animals, Waterborne animals and Insect.
    
    Tara - it is used to denote the birth star compatibility of the person.
    
    Yoni - is the sexual compatibility the two people would share with each other.
    
    Rasyadhipati - This defines who is the Lord of the zodiac.
    
    Gana - The three Ganas in Astrology are; Dev, Manav and Rakshasa.
    
    Rashi - This category denotes love that the two people would share. The category takes into account the exact position of the Moon in the bride’s and groom’s horoscope.
    
    Nandi - Nadi Koot is related to the health of the bride and the groom. The three Nadis in astrology are Vata (air), Pitta (bile) and Kappa (phlegm).
    
    Altogether, it is believed that at least 18 gunas must match for the marriage to be a fruitful one. The more the Guns match, the merrier it is for the couple. However, at times when Kundli does not match, an astrologer shall study the position of the planets and the reasons behind the lack of compatibility, and based on the same, can help you with remedies to solve the problem related to the lack of Gun Milan.
    
    Besides anything else, Kundli matching also helps in finding if the matchmaking will lead to Nandi dosha in the life of the couple. For the unaware, Nadi Dosha deals with the difficulty in childbirth, which is one of the main reasons for dissatisfaction in the family. If Madhya Nandi dosha is prevalent, the couple may not be able to conceive. The reason: Naadi indicates Prakriti (basic element) of a person. These Prakritis are Vaata, Pitta and Kapha. If both the partners are born with the same Prakriti, the points obtained under Naadi would be zero and thus hampers child birth.
    
    Hence it is always better to opt for gun milan or kundli milan so you know well in advance the problems that could come in your relationship and also the solutions to the same.
