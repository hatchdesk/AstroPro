            <h3>Muhurat</h3>
         <p> In astrology, “Muhurat” is like finding the perfect time for important stuff. It’s when the planets and stars align just right, and it’s considered lucky for specific tasks. People call it different names like “Kala” or “times of power.”
  
          So, Muhurat is when you should start or do something important, like opening a business, buying a house, getting a job, or getting married. It depends on where the stars and planets are.
  
          Knowing the “Aaj ka shubh Muhurat” or the lucky time of the day today can help you plan important events. For example, if you want to celebrate your child’s birth or buy a car in 2023, Astropush can tell you the best times to do it. It’s like a green light for your plans.
  
          Muhurat Horoscope for Special Occasions
          A Muhurat Horoscope is like a special plan based on a person’s horoscope. It looks at where the planets are, the moon’s position, time periods called ‘Dasha,’ and the star group called ‘Nakshatra.’ With all this info, it figures out the best and luckiest times for an important event.
  
          For example, if you want to move into a new house, the right Muhurat means you should enter and start living in the new place during a specific time. Or if you’re building a house, the right Muhurat means you should begin the construction with the right tools at a certain time. These special times are usually available every day, but they only last for a few minutes, and that’s when you should start your task.
  
          You can also pick the right Muhurat for big events like getting married, getting engaged, moving into a new house, starting a new business, or opening an office. It’s all about making sure you start these important things at the luckiest moments.
